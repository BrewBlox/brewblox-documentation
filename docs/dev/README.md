# Developer documentation

Brewblox is a rapidly evolving system that welcomes external contributions. To reflect this, developer documentation is split in four subcategories:

**Tutorials** show how to create and run simple scripts.
These are useful for everyone that wants to tinker with their own system.
The source code for all tutorials is also available [here](https://github.com/BrewBlox/brewblox-documentation/tree/develop/docs/dev/tutorials).

**Migrations** provides additional information on various configuration and data migrations as Brewblox develops.

**Using brewblox-service** is for those wishing to create a new service.
These documents describe the wider context of the system, and how to use the available APIs.

**Reference documents** describe protocols and interfaces, and are updated whenever these change.

**Design decisions** are documents describing past research and the context for major decisions.
These are not updated: if a decision changes or is reversed, a new document is added. This ensures that not only the current state is known, but also the process that led us there.
