```gherkin
Feature: Data management
Values measured by controller blocks are captured
Configuration is captured
Configuration changes are captured
Events are captured
User annotations are captured

    Scenario: Display process data
        Given there is an active view
        And the active view contains UI blocks with a hardware association
        When I click the Display View Data button
        Then I should see all data generated by the view's UI blocks

    Scenario: Display UI block data
        Given there is an active UI block
        And the UI block has a hardware association
        When I click the Display UI block Data button
        Then I should see all data generated by this UI block

    Scenario: Changed UI block association
        Given there is an active UI block
        And the UI block has a hardware association
        And the UI block used to have a different hardware association
        When I click the Display UI block Data button
        Then I should see all data generated by this UI block's current hardware assocation
        And I should see an annotation where UI block association was changed
        And I should see data generated by previous hardware association

    Scenario: Add annotation
        Given process data is being displayed
        When I click the Add Annotation button
        Then an input field should appear
        And the text I enter here is added to the graph
        And when I refresh the data, the annotation is displayed
