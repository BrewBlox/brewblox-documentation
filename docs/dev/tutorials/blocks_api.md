# Spark blocks API

A central component of Brewblox systems is the Spark controller.
Custom services that wish to read or write blocks will typically interface with the Spark service API to do so.

:::tip
Spark service endpoints are documented using Swagger.
For comprehensive endpoint documentation, navigate to `http://{HOST}/{SERVICE_ID}/api/doc` in your browser.
