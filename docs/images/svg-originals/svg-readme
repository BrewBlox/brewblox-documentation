- Markdown does not have native support for sizing images. This can be done in HTML. Currently image sizes are used as is or automatically resized (reduced) to line width upon load.

Vector:
- vector images are created in Inkscape and stored as SVG
  - Inkscape page margins: 1pt (all sides)
- Big SVG-files are compressed with https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/ were effective
- SVG uncompressed originals are stored in ..\svg-originals\ for future modification

Raster:
- raster images are stored as JPG for use on the website
- JPG files are exported in GIMP at 90-95% quality level
- full page width raster images are stored at 1200px width, 96 dpi


Workflow:
Vector: Create SVG (Inkscape) -> store original -> compress big SVG's -> website
Raster: Manipulate original (GIMP) -> store as XCF -> export JPG -> website
